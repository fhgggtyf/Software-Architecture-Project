Retail Store Application – Software Architecture Project

This repository contains a minimal retail application built as part of a software architecture course. The goal of this checkpoint is to demonstrate how to structure a two‑tier system (client + database) using Python’s standard library only. It provides a simple web interface for managing a product catalogue, registering/logging in users, adding items to a cart and checking out. All data is stored locally in an SQLite database and the persistence layer is abstracted via Data Access Objects (DAOs).

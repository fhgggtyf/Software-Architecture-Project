"""
Comprehensive test harness for the Retail Store Application.

This script attempts to exercise the majority of quality‑attribute scenarios
described in the project documentation.  It launches the HTTP server
(`app_web.py`) on a high port and then runs a suite of test cases.  Each
test prints its name, what it is verifying, and the observed outcome.  After
all tests are complete, the server is stopped cleanly.

The tests included here cover the following categories:

* **Availability/Performance** – generates high concurrency load against
  the `/products` endpoint to approximate flash‑sale conditions and reports
  average and 95th percentile latencies.  This test can be tuned via the
  `NUM_REQUESTS` and `CONCURRENCY` constants.
* **Security** – attempts to interact with the system in ways that should
  be rejected, such as sending malicious inputs and calling non‑existent
  endpoints.  It checks that the server does not execute injected
  JavaScript and returns 404 for unknown partner endpoints.
* **Modifiability** – ingests partner feeds in both CSV and JSON formats
  using the adapter pattern.  A successful insert/update confirms the
  ability to extend to new feed formats without changing core logic.
* **Performance** – stresses the checkout process via direct calls to
  `RetailApp.checkout` with different payment methods.  It measures
  checkout duration and exercises the circuit breaker by forcing
  repeated failures.
* **Integrability** – calls the partner ingestion adapter directly with
  multiple formats and invalid data.  The system should gracefully skip
  invalid rows and upsert valid ones.
* **Testability** – fetches the `/metrics` endpoint after load tests and
  partner ingestions, ensuring that counters and histograms are exposed.
  It also tails the application log to verify that structured logging is
  configured and that events are recorded.
* **Usability** – performs a checkout using an unsupported payment method
  via the HTTP API and checks that the user receives a clear error
  response.

Not every scenario from the assignment can be fully automated in this
prototype (for example, database failover, adding new partner formats,
integration with real third‑party services or a sophisticated flash‑sale UI).
Where behaviour is not implemented in the reference application, the
corresponding test prints a warning so that you can extend the
application or the tests accordingly.  The expanded test suite below
adds additional test functions to exercise each of the quality
attribute scenarios described in the documentation.  These include
database failover recovery, partner feed authentication, support for
new partner feed formats, extensible payment methods, high‑load
performance, concurrent checkout behaviour, onboarding new resellers,
third‑party service integrations, replayable workloads for testability,
integration tests with external services, and flash‑sale usability.
